# Introduction
* Talk about what an arduino is

# Digital
* Introduce digitalread / digitalwrite functionality
* Demonstrate digitalwrite with an LED

# Analog stuff
* Introduce analogwrite ("what if we want different brightnesses")
* Demonstrate with the LED
* Introduce analogread
* Demonstrate with the LED / pot

# PWM / Servo
* Introduce PWM (this is how you simulate analog writes)
* Demonstrate PWM with the the servo (alternative uses)

# PySerial, RasPi(?)
* Introduce serial on Arduino
* Introduce Raspberry Pi / Linux ("this could be your laptop")
* Demonstrate simple serial communication between the two

# Libraries
* Talk about libraries
* Hook up the LED strip, use the pololu examples

# Final Demo
* Finish with the full LED strip demo, potentially live coded?
* Walk through the code
